# GECAM_geometry
This package is to calculate detectors`s centre in the sky on board GRCAM A and B. It just a  concise version.
But you need to build a database like :

burst database: topdir/sample\_name/GECAM\_A(and /GECAM\_B)/datafiles

daily database: topdir/GECAM\_A(and /GECAM\_B)/year/month/day/datafiles
